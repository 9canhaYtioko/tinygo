## What is Fake NP V9?
 
Fake NP V9 is a tool that was created by a hacker named Yoti in 2011. It can fake the signature of an official PSN game and inject it into a PSP ISO, creating an EBOOT.PBP file that can run on OFW. This way, you can play your backup games without hacking your PSP or using any plugins. However, Fake NP V9 has some drawbacks:
 
- It only supports ISOs that are smaller than 728 MB. If your ISO is larger than that, you need to compress it or split it into parts.
- It requires a base game that you have purchased from the PSN store. You need to use the license file of that game to sign your ISO. If you delete the base game from your PSP, you will lose the license file and your converted games will stop working.
- It may not work with some games that have complex encryption or protection mechanisms. Some games may crash or freeze when running on OFW.
- It may not be compatible with some PSP models or firmware versions. Some users have reported that Fake NP V9 does not work on PSP Go or PSP 3000 with 6.60 OFW.

## How to Use Fake NP V9?
 
To use Fake NP V9, you need the following:

- A PSP with OFW 6.20 or higher.
- A base game that you have purchased from the PSN store and downloaded to your PSP.
- A PSP ISO that is smaller than 728 MB or compressed or split into parts.
- A PC with Windows XP or higher.

## Conclusion
 
Fake NP V9 is a useful tool for playing backup games on OFW without hacking your PSP or using any plugins. However, it has some limitations and risks that you need to be aware of before using it. You also need to respect the copyright laws of your country and only use it for games that you own legally. If you want more flexibility and compatibility, you might want to consider installing a CFW or a HEN on your PSP instead.

## How does Usbutil 21 Ultimate English Version Hit work?
 
Usbutil 21 Ultimate English Version Hit works by creating a configuration file (ul.cfg) that contains information about the games that are stored on the USB device. This file is then read by USBExtreme or USBAdvance when the PS2 boots from the USB device. The configuration file tells the PS2 which game to load and how to access it from the USB device.
 
To create a configuration file, users need to run Usbutil 21 Ultimate English Version Hit on their PC and select the ISO files or backup CDs/DVDs of their PS2 games. The software will then scan the files and display information such as game name, size, region, etc. Users can then choose which games they want to add to the configuration file and where to save it on the USB device. Users can also edit the game names, delete games, or split large games into smaller parts.

The Genie Mod is a game pack that requires no additional expansions or packs to work. It adds a new trait, aspiration, and interactions to the game. To become a genie, you can either complete the Wish Hunter aspiration or choose the genie trait in CAS. Genies have different needs and skills than regular sims, and they can also use magic spells to affect other sims.
 
One of the main features of the mod is the ability to offer wishes to other sims. You can do this by clicking on a sim and selecting "Offer A Wish". There are different types of wishes you can grant, such as work, fitness, love, or random buffs. However, be careful what you wish for, as the outcome might not always be what you expect. Sometimes, the wish might backfire and cause the opposite effect or something worse.
 
If you want to add a genie to your household, you can either ask them to move in with you or wish for them to become a regular sim. You can also customize their appearance and personality in CAS. However, once they lose their genie powers, they cannot get them back.

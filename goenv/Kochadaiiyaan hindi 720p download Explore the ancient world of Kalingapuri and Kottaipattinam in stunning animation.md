# Kochadaiiyaan: A Spectacular Animated Adventure in Hindi
 
Kochadaiiyaan is a 2014 Indian motion capture 3D computer-animated film directed by Soundarya Rajinikanth and starring Rajinikanth, Deepika Padukone, R. Sarathkumar, Jackie Shroff and Nassar. The film is based on a historical fantasy story set in two warring kingdoms, Kottaipattinam and Kalingapuri. Rajinikanth plays a dual role of Kochadaiiyaan, a legendary general of Kottaipattinam, and his son Rana, who seeks revenge against the king of Kalingapuri for killing his father.
 
The film was made using motion capture technology, which captures the movements and expressions of real actors and transforms them into animated characters. The film was also dubbed in Hindi and released on Prime Video[^1^]. The film received mixed reviews from critics, who praised the music by A.R. Rahman, the voice-over work by the actors and the story by K.S. Ravikumar, but criticized the animation quality and the lack of emotional impact.

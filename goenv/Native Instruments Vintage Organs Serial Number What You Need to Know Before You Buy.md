## How to Use Native Instruments Vintage Organs?
 
Native Instruments Vintage Organs is a Kontakt instrument that can be used either standalone or as a plugin in your DAW. You can access the different manuals of each organ by using separate MIDI channels or by using the Keysplit mode. You can also switch between presets and adjust the sound parameters using the Organ and Amp pages. You can also assign any MIDI controller to any parameter for more expressive playing. Here are some tips and tricks to get the most out of Vintage Organs:

- Use the Direct Sound option to separate the bass manual from the upper two and bypass the effect chain. This way, you can get a clean and warm bass tone that blends well with other instruments.
- Use the Rotary effect to add motion and depth to your organ sound. You can control the speed and acceleration of the rotary speaker with your modwheel, pedal or aftertouch.
- Use the Overdrive effect to add some grit and distortion to your organ sound. You can adjust the amount and tone of the overdrive with the Drive and EQ knobs.
- Use the Reverb effect to add some ambience and space to your organ sound. You can choose between true plate and spring impulse responses for different reverb flavors.
- Use the Envelope controls to shape the attack and release of your organ sound. You can remove the characteristic click by lowering the attack, or create unusual effects by increasing the release.

## Step 1: Install Adobe Ultra CS3

If you have a downloaded file, open the folder and double-click Setup.exe to start the installation process. You will need to enter the serial number that came with your software package[^2^]. The autorun is in Japanese, but the installer itself is also available in English[^2^].
 
## Step 2: Launch Adobe Ultra CS3
 
To launch Adobe Ultra CS3, go to Start > All Programs > Adobe > Adobe Ultra CS3 > Adobe Ultra CS3. You will see the main interface of the software, which consists of four main areas: the Project panel, where you can import and organize your video clips; the Monitor panel, where you can preview and edit your video; the Properties panel, where you can adjust the settings of your video and effects; and the Tools panel, where you can access various tools and commands.
 
## Step 3: Import Your Video Clips
 
To import your video clips, go to File > Import > File and browse to the location of your video files. You can also drag and drop your files from Windows Explorer to the Project panel.

To add your video clips to the timeline, drag and drop them from the Project panel to the Timeline panel at the bottom of the screen.

Drag and drop your chosen set or background to the timeline below your keyed clip. You can adjust the position, scale, rotation, and perspective of your set or background in relation to your keyed clip using the Properties panel.
 
## Step 8: Export Your Video

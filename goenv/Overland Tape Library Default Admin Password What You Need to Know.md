One of the common components of Overland tape library is the remote management interface (RMI), which allows users to access and manage the tape library from a web browser. The RMI provides various functions, such as monitoring the status and performance of the tape library, configuring the settings and options, updating the firmware, running diagnostics and troubleshooting. The RMI also allows users to perform tape operations, such as loading, unloading, inventorying, cleaning and formatting tapes.
 
To access the RMI, users need to know the IP address or host name of the tape library, as well as the login credentials. The default login credentials for Overland tape library are:
 
- Access type: admin
- Password: adm001

Users can change the password and other settings after logging in to the RMI. However, if users forget the password or lose access to the RMI, they can reset the password by following these steps:

1. Power off the tape library.
2. Press and hold the reset button on the back panel of the tape library for 10 seconds.
3. Power on the tape library.
4. Wait for the tape library to initialize.
5. Access the RMI using the default login credentials.
6. Change the password and other settings as desired.

For more information about Overland tape library and its RMI, users can refer to the user manual or service manual of their specific model[^1^] [^2^]. Users can also contact Overland Tandberg technical support for assistance[^4^].
